# HACKATHON MODE — SPEED OVER PERFECTION
**Demo story:** Agentwiki loop (search → retrieve Method Cards → plan → execute → evaluate → write back) + side-by-side Run 1 vs Run 2 with measurable improvement. When I say "just make it work", "quick fix", "fast version", or "demo mode":
- Skip type hints
- Skip docstrings
- Combine files if needed
- Use hardcoded demo data if APIs aren't cooperating
- Prioritize: does it RUN and does it LOOK good?

# THE DEMO MUST NEVER CRASH
These three things MUST always be in place, no matter what:
1. try/except around every API call with a friendly fallback message
2. st.session_state initialization for every stateful variable
3. A check for missing API keys at app startup that shows a warning instead of crashing:
```python
import os
missing_keys = [k for k in ["GROQ_API_KEY","OPENROUTER_API_KEY","MISTRAL_API_KEY","GEMINI_API_KEY"] if not os.getenv(k)]
if missing_keys:
    st.warning(f"⚠️ Missing API keys: {', '.join(missing_keys)}. Some features may not work.")
```

# HARDCODED DEMO DATA (use when APIs won't cooperate during demo)
```python
DEMO_RESPONSES = [
    "Here's a professional response tailored to your needs...",
    "Based on your preferences, I've improved this response...",
    "After learning from your feedback, here's an even better version..."
]
# Use: output = DEMO_RESPONSES[min(st.session_state.interaction_count, 2)]
```

# FAST UI TRICK (looks polished in 2 minutes)
Add this after the title — makes any Streamlit app look 10x more professional:
```python
st.markdown("---")
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
col1.metric("🧠 Generation", st.session_state.get('generation', 1))
col2.metric("⭐ Avg Score", f"{st.session_state.get('avg_score', 0):.1f}/5")
col3.metric("💬 Interactions", st.session_state.get('interaction_count', 0))
st.markdown("---")
```

# WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY
Tell me:
1. The exact error message (copy paste it)
2. Which line it points to
3. What you just changed
I will fix ONLY that issue. Nothing else.

# IF CURSOR RUNS OUT OF FAST REQUESTS
Switch to: Ask mode (slower but uses fewer fast credits)
Or: Open Claude.ai, paste the file with @filename pattern, ask the same question.

# GOOD COMMIT MESSAGES FOR HACKATHON
git commit -m "feat: add self-improvement loop"
git commit -m "feat: ElevenLabs voice output"
git commit -m "fix: crash on empty memory"
git commit -m "ui: polish demo panel"
git commit -m "demo: add before/after comparison"
