# LOGS.MDC — CHANGE LOG (ALWAYS APPLY)

After every change you make to the project (new feature, fix, refactor, config):

1. Open `logs.md`.
2. Append one new line at the end. Do not edit or remove previous lines.
3. Format: `## Log N — Short summary of the change` (N = next number).
4. Keep the summary short and straightforward (e.g. "Add ElevenLabs voice button", "Fix crash when memory is empty").

Example after 3 changes:
```markdown
## Log 1 — Add Streamlit app shell and session state
## Log 2 — Wire agent.py to Gemini with try/except fallback
## Log 3 — Add 5-star rating widget and save to memory
```

We do not play with or change previous logs — we only add on.
